# personify-chrome-extension
A chrome extension which overrides chrome's new tab and:
1) Shows time with a salutation and a different inspirational quote on every refresh.
2) shows weather of any city (by-default set to Delhi) but can be changed and name can also be changed.
3) It helps you maintain a todo-list which will remain intact in every situation.
and last but not the least...my favorite part- toggles between light and dark mode and links to my favorite websites at the bottom...!!
